                        <h2>The Hacker Mind: Profiling the IT Criminal</h2>
                        <p id="TheID">Cyber space has increased human communication, connectivity, creativity, capacity and crime by leaps and bounds in the last decade. For all of the positive aspects it offers, it offers as many negative aspects. Those negative aspects are explored and developed by everyone from the high school challenge hacker to the international terrorist. Businesses, governmental agencies, militaries, and organizations of every kind are threatened by the IT criminal. This course will survey the spectrum of psychological attributes which may make up the profile of the IT criminal.</p>

                        <h2>Secure Programming</h2>
                        <p id="TheID">This course provides the essential and fundamental skills for secure programming. The most prevalent reason behind buggy code and vulnerabilities being exploited by hackers and malicious code is the lack of adoption of secure coding practices. This program will ensure that students are exposed to the inherent security drawbacks in various programming languages or architectures. They will be exposed to exercise secure programming practices to overcome these inherent drawbacks to preempt bugs from the code.</p>
